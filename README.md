# Meat-Quality-Assessment-System
In this project, I embarked on an innovative journey to develop a comprehensive solution for meat quality assessment through image analysis. My approach involved a systematic process that encompassed data collection, image preprocessing, model development, and website creation.
Beginning with the collection of a diverse dataset, I am harnessed the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify meat quality attributes.  The dataset, initially comprising two classes, 'Fresh' and 'Spoiled,' was expanded to include a novel class, 'Others,' through the application of web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup. This additional class incorporated images beyond the scope of meat, enhancing the model's ability to identify non-meat elements.Prior to model training, a meticulous image preprocessing phase was undertaken. This phase encompassed resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation, optimizing our dataset for robust and reliable model training. Subsequently, we constructed a CNN model, leveraging its inherent ability to discern intricate patterns within images. The result was a highly accurate classifier capable of discerning meat quality attributes.
Moreover, my endeavor extended beyond model development to user interaction and accessibility. I am seamlessly integrated our model into a user-friendly website using HTML, allowing users to easily upload images for assessment. This dynamic platform empowers individuals to effortlessly determine the quality of meat based on images, bridging the gap between technological advancements and real-world applications. my project encapsulates the convergence of data science, machine learning, and web development, offering a holistic solution that can redefine the way meat quality assessment is performed. As the journey continues, my work opens avenues for further exploration, including advanced CNN architectures, interactive visualizations, and seamless integration into industry processes, ultimately shaping the future of meat quality assessment.
